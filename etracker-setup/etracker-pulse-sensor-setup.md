# Pulse Sensor Setup

An eTracker can support up to 4 pulse sensors while an AVO can support 2 pulse sensors. To add a pulse sensor to your station, navigate to the Station Management page and select 'Pulse Sensors' from the side menu. On the Pulse Sensor Summary page click the '+ Sensor' button. Follow the steps below to add your new pulse sensor.

### Pulse Sensor Setup Steps

1.  Give your new sensor a unique name and select a logging interval which corresponds to the interval in which you would like your data logging device to query the sensor for readings. Click 'Next'.
2.  You can now add your sensor's parameter configurations.
3.  Click the 'Finish' button to create your new pulse sensor.
4.  You should now see your new pulse sensor in the side menu list as well as the Pulse Sensor Summary page. Click on the sensor from either list to make further configurations.
