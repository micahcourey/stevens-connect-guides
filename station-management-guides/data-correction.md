# Data Correction

<span class="app-name"></span> provides a data correction feature which allows you to set corrected values or perform mathematical operations on a sensor's reported readings. You can perform these operations on either a single reading, all readings or a subset of readings filtered by date. You can also add readings to your sensor if needed. Follow the steps below to correct your sensors logged data.

### Data Correction Steps

1.  Navigate to the Station Management page of the station that contains the data you would like to correct.
2.  Select 'Data Management' from the side menu and then select 'Data Correction' from the sub-items.
3.  From the list of sensors, select the sensor that needs corrected data.
4.  Select the parameter that contains the values that need to be corrected.
5.  You should now see a table of data with a reading timestamp for each reported reading. You can filter the readings with the date selector above the table.
6.  Click the check boxes next to the readings you want to correct.
7.  Once you have selected the readings to correct you can click any of the buttons below the table to perform the appropriate action.
    -   Delete Selection: Click this button if you want to delete the selected readings.
    -   Set Corrected Value: Click this button to set a fixed value to all of the selected readings.
    -   Apply operation: Click this button to perform a mathematical operation (+, -, /, *) on the selected readings.
8.  You should now see the corrected values in the table but note that these corrected values have not been saved yet.
9.  Perform any other corrections to the data and when your satisfied with your corrections, press the 'Save' button to save these corrected values to the database. Note that if you made a mistake you can press the 'Revert' button to revert back to the originally recorded readings prior to saving. Once you click 'Save' you can NOT revert back to the original data but you can click on the 'History' tab to see which readings have been modified along with their original values.
