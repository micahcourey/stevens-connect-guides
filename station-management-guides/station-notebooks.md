# Station Notebooks

Every Station has it's own set of station notebooks which can be accessed from the Station Management page. Station notebooks are extremely flexible and can be used for various purposes (e.g. maintenance logs, station notes, station images...). Each notebook holds a collection of notes. You can style a note, add images, lists, and tags. It's up to you to decide what you want to put in your notebook. You may want to use a notebook to log station visits/maintenance or to provide instructions for station technicians. You can create multiple notebooks and use each notebook for a different purpose.

### Steps to Create a Station Notebook

1.  Navigate to your Station Management page. Select the 'Misc' option from the side menu and click 'Station Notebooks'.
2.  Click the '+ Notebook' button on the top right of the Notebooks page.
3.  Give your new notebook a name and press the 'Create' button.
4.  Congrats you made your first notebook! Now you can open your Notebook and press the '+ Note' button to start adding notes.
