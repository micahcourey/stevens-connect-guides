# Building Charts and Data Tables in Trends

The Trends feature gives the user a clean and intuitive interface to build custom charts and data tables from your sensors across all stations in your project. 

### Building Charts and Data Tables in Trends Steps

1. Navigate to your project's dashboard and select 'Trends' from the side menu.
2. Select parameters from the list navigating by station or by unit or use the search field to find parameters by name. You can add a single parameter or multiple parameters from multiple stations to the same chart/table. When you click a parameter you should see a new line added to the chart and a key to identify it.
3. A line chart is displayed by default. Click the 'Table' button on the right side of the toolbar above the chart. Notice that now your data is displayed on a table instead of a chart. You can switch between chart and table by clicking these toolbar buttons at any time.
4. Click the 'Chart' button to switch back to chart display and click the 'Selected' tab below the chart to apply customization options to each parameter including color, chart type and precision.
5. Click the 'Options' tab to apply advanced configurations to your chart:
    - **Auto scale**: Auto scale is applied by default. You can uncheck the 'Auto scale' box to configure a custom scale.
    - **Transformations**: No transformations are applied by default but you have the option to apply averaging, accumulation, or rate of change transformations on your data set.
    - **Plot Lines**: The lines will always be perpendicular to the axis it is defined within.
6. Click the 'Model' tab to plot regression lines onto your chart. 
7. Once you're finished configuring the chart you have a few options for saving your chart or table if desired:
	  - **Print Chart**: Click the menu button in the top right corner of the chart and select the 'Print chart' option.
	  - **Download Chart**: Click the menu in the top right corner of the chart and select one of the download options. Download file format options include PNG, JPEG, SVG and PDF.
	  - **Download Table**: Click the 'Save' button in the top right corner of the table and the download will begin automatically.
	  - **Add To Dashboard**: You also have the option to save what you built to one of your dashboard profiles as a widget. Click the 'Add To Dashboard' button which is directly below the table on the right.
8. If you chose the 'Add To Dashboard' option, you should now see your new widget on the dashboard. 
9. You can now resize and position your new widget. When you're satisfied with your widget's size and placement, be sure to click the 'Save' button in the top right corner to save your layout and return to display mode.
