# Application Overview

<span class="app-name"></span> is a cloud-based data acquisition and management software system that enables the collection, analysis, reporting, and storage of data from remote monitoring locations. As a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, <span class="app-name"></span> streamlines the data management process and can be accessed from any computer or smartphone with Internet connectivity.

<span class="app-name"></span> manages data from multiple locations and reduces the need for a localized data management software and data collection hardware.

-   Immediate access to data, anywhere, any device.
-   Reduced IT requirements: no need for upgrades, transfer to other PCs, uptime maintenance, security.
-   No special hardware required, other than a modem at each monitoring location.
-   No software to install or reinstall.
-   Easily scalable: add additional station data collection when needed. Access data from any number of computers, even simultaneously.
-   Data can be received via cellular (CDMA and GSM) or satellite communications (GOES, Iridium, Inmarsat)

### Drag-and-drop Customizable Dashboards

Customizable dashboards lets each user configure what at-a-glance data to show and how. Drag-and-drop widgets, place them where you want and stretch to resize. Choose high-visibility single data values, line graphs, bar charts, fuel-gauge style graphs, 360° directional graphs and more, for any parameter your station is measuring.

### Custom Calculations

Perform simple to complex math functions using a sensor's data as variables and display the resulting calculated data as graphs or tables. This feature is compatible with any sensor including third-party sensors. 

### Remotely Configure Hardware

<span class="app-name"></span> provides a straightforward interface for configuring your remote  [M2M](https://www.stevenswater.com/m2m)  hardware ([eTracker](https://www.stevenswater.com/products/etracker)). Control all aspects of the station including logging and reporting intervals and configuration of all analog, pulse and SDI-12 sensors. Make changes at any time, even if the station is in low-power (sleep) mode—all changes made will be synced to the remote station when it next transmits.

So rather than travel to the site to reconfigure, do it from anywhere there’s an Internet connection. Rather than writing code or scripts, use a simple graphical interface. Rather than installing an app or other software and requiring a specific computer, do it with any Internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, Mac or PC).

### Forward or Export Data

<span class="app-name"></span> is an easy to use and easily accessible reporting and analysis tool: Ideal for visualizing your remote data. However, if you prefer to use other software, that’s no problem: data can be automatically formatted and forwarded to your server, or you can choose to export the data to work with it in Microsoft Excel.
