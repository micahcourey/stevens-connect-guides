### User Creation Steps

Note that your account level must be **Project Administrator** in order to create new users. 

 1. Navigate to the Administration page by clicking the user menu in the top right corner of the page and selecting 'Administration'. Note that only Project Administrators have access to the Administration page.
 2. From the Administration page select the 'Users' item from the side menu.
 3. You should now be on the User Summary page. Click the '+ User' button in the top right corner of the page.
 4. Begin filling out the form fields. The user will log in with the email address that you provide in the email field. Enter the user's phone number following the guidelines provided to ensure that the correct country format is applied.
 5. Select a user role. Refer to the table above to determine the appropriate user role for your new user account. 
 6. Enable the appropriate contact method for this user. This setting determines the medium in which the user will receive alerts for triggered alarms. You can select either, none or both options.
 7. Finally, select which stations you want this user to be able to view/access. You can select the 'All stations visible' toggle to allow the user to view all stations in all projects or you can select each station individually.
 8. Once you're satisfied with your configurations, click the 'Add User' button. You should now see your new user in the side menu user sub-list.
 9. Click the new user from the side menu to verify or update the user's configurations.
