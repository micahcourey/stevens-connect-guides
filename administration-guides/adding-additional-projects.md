# Adding Additional Projects

For accounts that control several stations, projects allow you to organize your stations into multiple sections. By default your account contains a single initial project which all of your stations are stored in. For many use cases a single project makes the most sense. However, if your account contains several stations which are in different regions or are managed by different users, creating additional projects can add another layer of organization. Note that once you create a station in a project you can **Not** move the station to a different project. Follow the steps below to add additional projects to your account.

### Project Creation Steps

1. Navigate to the Administration page by clicking the user menu in the top right corner of the page and selecting 'Administration'. Note that only Project Administrators have access to the Administration page.
2. From the Administration page select the 'Projects' item from the side menu.
3. Click the '+ Project' button in the top right corner of the Project Summary page.
4. Give your project a unique name. Click the 'Submit' button. 
5. Select your new project from the side menu to add new stations to the project. From this page you can also apply advanced configurations including setting up a [Data Warehouse](data-warehouse-setup).
